    "heading": "Harry and her birthday",
    "content": "Harry Potter is a widely loved fantasy fictional. We love all the characters of the series, even if the character is pure evil we find something good in them. It is because Rowling has put her pieces to the characters. And one of the examples of this is Her and Harry’s. She’s born on 31 July 1965 and Harry’s birthday in the book is 1980."

    "content": "J. K. Rowling had the idea of Harry Potter when she was waiting for her train from Manchester to England. She worked as a researcher and bilingual secretary in London for Amnesty International. She moved to Edinburgh in 1993 and started writing the book in the cafes of Edinburgh. Once in an interview, she said, “Edinburgh is very much home for me and is the place where Harry evolved over seven books and many, many hours of writing in its cafes.”"
